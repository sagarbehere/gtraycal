gtraycal
========

A standalone program providing a dropdown calendar that sits in the systray. Intended to emulate the functionality of the calendar in gnome2 panel

You need the python gtk2 bindings installed on your computer. For a debian based system, this can be done with

$ sudo aptitude install python-gtk2

You can run the program with the command

$ python gtraycal.py

Alternatively, you can set execute permissions (you need to do this only once)

$ chmod +x gtraycal.py

and run the program with

$ ./gtraycal.py
